          The guest speaker was the German climate protection activist Luisa Neubauer. She discussed the potential of
          modern technologies for climate and environmental protection with Mathias Döpfner, CEO of Axel Springer SE and
          since 2018 Chairman of the Open Circle event format. Luisa Neubauer is the German face of the „Fridays for
          Future“ movement. Thus, the discussion also revolved around the young political generation and how it changes
          society and politics through mass protests. Mathias Döpfner: “Saving the planet has become a passionate
          generation project. Together, we must now use the potential of future technologies and artificial intelligence
          to implement truly effective measures, rather than greenwashing, to achieve ecological progress.“
